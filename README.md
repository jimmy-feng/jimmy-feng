## Jimmy Feng

I am a Geography PhD Student and Lead Instructor of Geovisualization and Geographic Information Science at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://utk.edu), with anticipated graduation in Spring 2022.

My proposed dissertation draws from existing theories and conceptual frameworks to develop a new theoretical framework for a contemporary Geography of Access that relates together different concepts of space, time, and access. Focus is additionally given to identify how different types of data can be used for research into understanding the different dimensions of access and their conceptual extensions; and also how the proposed framework can be implemented with various methods to examine peopleâ€™s situations of access. A case study of food access will be used to apply these ideas in practice.

Beyond academia, I have worked in different capacities, primarily as a Geospatial Consultant, in the non-profit and public-government sectors. Most recently, I was a contractor for the [Geographic Visualization Lab at National Geographic Society](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/labs/geographic-visualization/) and worked on the development of a [10-meter dynamic global land cover map for data-driven habitat and species conservation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JW9Egg05I0gGHC6a6hHR1Hzbh55DARCM/view), location analyses for internal education programs, the procurement of maps and image composites for a science expedition in the Russian Arctic, and more. Before this experience, I constructed a geospatial database and developed strategies for property acquisition and the creation of a community land trust in Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY with [Community Solutions](https://community.solutions/). Prior to that, I researched recycling behaviors and streamlined the organic-waste collection program at the [New York City Department of Sanitation](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/organics). I have even made thematic maps at an [art gallery](https://www.chinatownsoup.nyc/).
